## How do I use this?

Simply download all the python files from the [src directory](src) and run main.py!

Make sure that the directory you have cloned this in has a text file called "token.txt" with your Discord token.

Your Discord token will not be sent to anyone other than Discord themselves as a request header.

## Why is the code so sloppy?

This is currently just a PoC, and I will continue to add new features and improve the current code behind it, but for now, it is poorly written.
